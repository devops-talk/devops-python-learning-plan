# Python Data Structures Practice Problems (Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables)

This set of problems focuses on **Binary Trees**, **Graphs**, and **Hash Tables**, which are essential for DevOps engineers to understand for managing hierarchical data, network structures, and efficient data storage and retrieval. The exercises are designed to help you reinforce these key data structures used in coding interviews and practical DevOps tasks.

## Binary Trees

### 1. Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion
- **Problem**: Implement a basic Binary Search Tree (BST) with methods to insert a value and perform in-order traversal.
- **Objective**: Understand the properties of a BST and practice tree traversal techniques.

## Graphs

### 2. Graph Traversal Using BFS
- **Problem**: Implement a graph traversal algorithm using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Represent the graph as an adjacency list.
- **Objective**: Practice BFS, a common graph traversal technique, to explore all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

### 3. Graph Traversal Using DFS
- **Problem**: Implement a graph traversal algorithm using Depth-First Search (DFS). Represent the graph as an adjacency list.
- **Objective**: Understand DFS, which explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.

## Hash Tables

### 4. Basic Hash Table Implementation
- **Problem**: Implement a simple hash table from scratch with methods for inserting, deleting, and searching elements using a hash function.
- **Objective**: Learn how hash tables work under the hood and how they enable fast data access.

## How to Use
1. Start by implementing the Binary Search Tree problem, understanding how data is stored in a hierarchical structure.
2. Move on to the graph traversal problems (BFS and DFS) to solidify your knowledge of graph data structures and traversal algorithms.
3. Finally, implement the hash table to practice efficient data storage and retrieval using hash functions.

Happy Coding!

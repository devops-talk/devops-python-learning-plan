# Python Data Structures Practice Problems (Lists, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists)

This set of problems focuses on **Lists**, **Stacks**, **Queues**, and **Linked Lists**, which are essential data structures for DevOps engineers to understand and implement. The exercises will help you improve your Python skills while reinforcing key concepts used in coding interviews and practical DevOps tasks.

## Lists Problems

### 1. Reverse a List
- **Problem**: Write a function that takes a list and returns the list in reverse order without using built-in methods like `reverse()`.
- **Objective**: Practice list manipulation and understand list traversal.

### 2. Find Maximum in a List
- **Problem**: Implement a function to find the maximum element in a list without using the built-in `max()` function.
- **Objective**: Gain practice in iterating through a list and comparing elements.

## Stack Problems

### 3. Stack Implementation Using a List
- **Problem**: Implement a simple stack using Python's list data structure. The stack should support `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()` operations.
- **Objective**: Learn stack operations and LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior.

### 4. Check for Balanced Parentheses (Stack Problem)
- **Problem**: Write a function to check if the parentheses in a given string are balanced. You should use a stack to solve this problem.
- **Objective**: Practice using a stack to solve a common problem involving matching parentheses.

## Queue Problems

### 5. Queue Implementation Using a List
- **Problem**: Create a queue using a Python list. The queue should support `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, and `peek()` operations.
- **Objective**: Understand FIFO (First In, First Out) operations using a list data structure.

### 6. Implement a Queue Using Two Stacks
- **Problem**: Implement a queue using two stacks. The queue should support standard queue operations like `enqueue()` and `dequeue()`.
- **Objective**: Combine stack and queue logic to understand how data structures can simulate one another.

## Linked List Problems

### 7. Find the Middle of a Linked List
- **Problem**: Implement a function that finds the middle element of a singly linked list. If the list has an even number of elements, return the second of the two middle elements.
- **Objective**: Understand how to traverse a linked list and find the middle.

### 8. Detect Cycle in a Linked List
- **Problem**: Write a function to detect if a linked list contains a cycle. Use Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (two-pointer technique).
- **Objective**: Practice implementing a common algorithm for cycle detection in linked lists.

### 9. Implement a Singly Linked List
- **Problem**: Create a basic implementation of a singly linked list with methods to `insert_at_head()`, `insert_at_tail()`, `delete_node()`, and `print_list()`.
- **Objective**: Understand the structure and operations of singly linked lists.

### 10. Implement a Doubly Linked List
- **Problem**: Implement a doubly linked list with methods to insert at both ends (`insert_at_head()` and `insert_at_tail()`) and delete a node (`delete_node()`).
- **Objective**: Learn the differences between singly and doubly linked lists and how to manage `prev` pointers.

## Stack and Queue with Linked List Problems

### 11. Stack Implementation Using Linked List
- **Problem**: Implement a stack using a linked list instead of a Python list. The stack should support `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()` operations.
- **Objective**: Learn how to use a linked list for stack operations and reinforce the concept of LIFO (Last In, First Out) behavior.

### 12. Queue Implementation Using Linked List
- **Problem**: Implement a queue using a linked list. The queue should support `enqueue()`, `dequeue()`, and `peek()` operations.
- **Objective**: Understand how to implement a queue using a linked list and reinforce the concept of FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior.

## How to Use
1. Start by implementing basic list manipulations in problems 1-2.
2. Move on to stacks and queues (problems 3-6), focusing on their unique behaviors.
3. Transition to linked lists and work through singly and doubly linked list implementations (problems 7-10).
4. Work on stack and queue implementation using linked lists (problems 11-12).
5. Work on understanding the underlying concepts behind each data structure, as these form the foundation for many DevOps-related tasks and coding interview questions.

Happy Coding!
